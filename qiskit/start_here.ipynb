    "# Qiskit Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome Qiskitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials aim to explain how to use Qiskit. We assume you have installed Qiskit; if not, please look at [qiskit.org](http://www.qiskit.org) or the install [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section outlining the features of Qiskit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest Qiskit version, currently 0.9. The focus of this section will be how to use Qiskit and not so much on teaching you about quantum computing. For those interested in learning about quantum computing we recommend the awesome [educational material](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/support) we and the community have put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit is made up of four elements: Terra, Aer, Ignis, and Aqua. Each element has its own goal, and together they make the full Qiskit framework. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of the software lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication.\n",

    "##  3 Qiskit Interacitve Plotting and Jupyter Tools\n",

    "##  4 Qiskit Aer\n",
    "\n",

    "Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers, we need better simulators with the ability to model realistic noise processes that occur during computation on actual devices. Aer provides a high-performance simulator framework for studying quantum computing algorithms and applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime. \n",

    "  \n",
    "##  5 Qiskit Ignis\n",
    "Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control. While we have already released parts of this element as part of libraries in Terra, an official stand-alone release will come soon. For now, we have some tutorials for you to explore.\n",

    "\n",
    "##  6 Qiskit Aqua\n",

    "Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world applications. Aqua is where algorithms for NISQ computers are built. These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing.\n",
